Preparing an effective resume is a difficult and time-consuming task. This handout
contains resume examples that will help you get started. Different formats and styles
are used to illustrate the various suggestions and tips contained in the handout,
"Preparing Your Resume," also available through the Bellevue University Career Services
Center.
Remember, these are intended to serve only as examples. You should modify or change
as appropriate to customize your resume according to your skills, experience, education,
and the job you’re applying.

A Word of Caution: Please don’t be tempted to use one of the
Resume Wizards or Templates that are available online or
included in many word processing programs. They can be difficult
to work with, don’t allow you to present yourself in the best
possible light—and employers can identify them easily. Instead,
create your resume as a simple document in MS Word, like the
examples included in this handout.
